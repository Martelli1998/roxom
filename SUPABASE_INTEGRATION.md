# Supabase Integration Summary

This document provides an overview of the Supabase authentication and user registration integration that has been implemented in the Roxom project.

## Files Created

1. **utils/supabaseClient.js** - Sets up the Supabase client with environment variables
2. **hooks/useAuth.js** - Custom hook for authentication functions (register, login, logout)
3. **contexts/AuthContext.js** - Context provider for global auth state management
4. **components/ProtectedRoute.js** - HOC to protect routes that require authentication
5. **pages/dashboard.js** - Example of a protected page that requires login
6. **SUPABASE_SETUP.md** - Step-by-step guide to set up Supabase project and database

## Features Implemented

### User Authentication
- Registration with name, email, and password
- Email/password login
- Logout functionality
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### Database Integration
- Users table to store additional user data
- Row-level security for data protection
- Automatic timestamps for created_at and updated_at

### UI Components
- Improved sign-in/registration modals
- Success/error messages for auth operations
- Loading states during authentication
- Dashboard page showing user profile data
- Conditional navigation based on auth state

## How to Use

1. Follow the instructions in SUPABASE_SETUP.md to create your Supabase project and database
2. Add your Supabase project URL and anonymous key to .env.local
3. Install the required dependency with `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
4. Run the application with `npm run dev`

## Auth Flow

1. Users can register via the "Sign In" button which opens the registration modal
2. Upon successful registration, users will need to confirm their email
3. After confirming email, users can sign in with their credentials
4. Authenticated users see a Dashboard link in the navigation
5. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page
6. Users can log out from either the navbar or the dashboard page

## Next Steps

1. Add password reset functionality
2. Implement social auth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Create admin dashboard for user management
4. Add more user profile details and preferences
5. Create subscription or payment integration
